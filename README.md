## ‚ú® Features

## üöÄ How It Works

3.  **Browse & Select:** Your Steam game library will load. Simply check the boxes for the games you want to idle (up to 32).
4.  **Optional: Set a Status:** Choose to set a custom status for your 32nd slot if you don't want to idle a 32nd game.
5.  **Start Idling!** Hit the "Start Idling" button. The app will run in the background, managing everything for you. Watch the hours roll in!

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is this safe? Will I get banned?

This application uses the same underlying technology as many popular and long-standing Steam bots (`steam-user`). It mimics a legitimate game client. While no third-party tool can ever be *100% guaranteed*, this method has been used safely by the community for years. **It does not modify Steam files or use VAC-protected game code.** Use at your own discretion.

### Why can I only idle 32 games?

This is a technical limitation of the Steam network. A single account can only report being "in-game" for a maximum of 32 titles at any given time. This app pushes that limit to the absolute maximum.

### Can I use my computer while idling?

Absolutely! The app runs as a background process. You can browse the web, work, or even play non-Steam games without interrupting the idling session.

### What happens when I get all my card drops?

The app will continue to idle the game, adding to your playtime. It's up to you to stop the session or deselect games that have no more card drops remaining.
